# Executive Summary 
  The system presesnted in the Assignment 1 DFD.md file is a database that can manage policies, licenses, and vulnerabilities with open source software within a company. It addresses the issue of scanning new software for licenses and vulnerability in attempt catch as many bugs as possible. It provides a simple system that is capable of retrieving and storing software information that is useful for not only developers but also managers within the company. The system is flexible and easily workable for users. It saves valuable time when attempting to gather information on licenses and vulnerabilities in new software that may be introduced to a company. That being said, less developers are needed to gather information on new software.
  Advantages of this system are that it allows a developer to submit and scan software for lincenses and vulnerabilities by cross referencing it with a known license and vulnerability database. Once the software has been scanned it is then saved in a seperate database. A manager is able to query this prior, scanned software database database by using a software name to request license and vulnerability information on specific software. A manager is also given the ability to request, edit, or add new and existing policy in relation to new software.
